# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

## Overview

[Bricks](https://github.com/stefanobartoletti/bricks) is a WordPress starter theme with builtin Bootstrap 5 integration. It uses Gulp to manage tasks commonly needed in WordPress development.

It is built with modularity in mind, taking full advantage of `get_template_part()` both for templates and for theme functions.

It is jQuery-free, relying on VanillaJS both for its scripts and for external dependencies.

It is lightweight and SEO friendly, by optimizing all of its assets and using semantic HTML and best practices.

::: warning
Bricks was born as a personal project, and should be currently considered as a beta. It is perfectly usable and it is already a good foundation for a WordPress project, but there is room for improvement, and changes, even relevant ones, should be expected.

Contributions are warmly welcome, especially about:

-   code quality
-   best practices
-   open-source project standards
