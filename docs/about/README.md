# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

I started to build Bricks in the beginning of 2019 for my own use, both to provide me with a base for my projects and to have an in-depth understanding on how WordPress works.

After two years of internal development and testing I decided to release it publicly: I believe that it has the potential to be interesting also for other developers. It is, as a matter of fact, my first open-source project.

While suiting my needs and providing an excellent foundation for my web-development projects, it is of course improvable in many ways, and keeping it up-to-date is always an ongoing activity.

Furthermore, this documentation site has become an interesting project on its own: it is built with [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), a static site generator based on the popular frontend framework [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), and it is a source of a lot of new things to learn and dive deep into.

For these reasons, I kindly welcome any kind of feedback, suggestion and contribution, both for the theme itself and for this documentation. Both repositories are hosted on GitHub:

  - Theme: [https://github.com/stefanobartoletti/bricks](https://github.com/stefanobartoletti/bricks)
  - Documentation: [https://github.com/stefanobartoletti/bricks-docs](https://github.com/stefanobartoletti/bricks-docs)
