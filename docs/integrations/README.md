# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

Bricks integrates with some popular WordPress plugins and with optional useful JavaScript libraries.

WordPress plugins integrations are small optimizations meant to speed up their setup inside the project.

Third-party JavaScript libraries are chosen for integration especially if they follow these criteria:

*   they share the same modularity principles as Bricks
*   they are lightweight and with few dependencies at most
*   they are based on plain JavaScript and don't require jQuery
*   they are well documented
*   they can be easily configured and work well within a WordPress theme
