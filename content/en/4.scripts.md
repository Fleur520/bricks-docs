## Scripts

Bricks comes with some predefined scripts, which are handy shortcuts to pre-configured Gulp serial tasks. **Yarn** is the preferred way to run scripts, but it is also possible to run them with plain **npm**.

### dev

<code-group>

<code-block label="Yarn" active> 

```bash
yarn dev
```
</code-block>

<code-block label="npm"> 

```bash
npm run dev
```

</code-block>

</code-group>

This script compiles all resources for a development environment (it uses `NODE_ENV=development` value). It is also run as a post-install script after the initial installation.

### watch

<code-group>

<code-block label="Yarn" active> 

```bash
yarn watch
```
</code-block>

<code-block label="npm"> 

```bash
npm run watch
```

</code-block>

</code-group>

This script starts both [Gulp watcher](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/watching-files/) and [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/), to automatically compile modified resources on-the-fly and inject them in your browser, during local development (like **dev**, it uses `NODE_ENV=development` value).
### build

<code-group>

<code-block label="Yarn" active> 

```bash
yarn build
```
</code-block>

<code-block label="npm"> 

```bash
npm run build
```

</code-block>

</code-group>

This script compiles all resources for a production environment (it uses `NODE_ENV=production` value). It performs minification and tree-shaking to reduce the size of the final resource bundles.
