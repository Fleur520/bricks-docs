## Overview

[Bricks](https://github.com/stefanobartoletti/bricks) is a WordPress starter theme with builtin [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) integration. It uses [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to manage tasks commonly needed in WordPress development. 

It is built with modularity in mind, taking advantage of `get_template_part()` both for templates and for theme functions. 

It is jQuery-free, relying on VanillaJS both for its scripts and for external dependencies, including [Bootstrap Native](https://thednp.github.io/bootstrap.native/).

It is lightweight and SEO friendly, by optimizing all of its assets and using semantic HTML and best practices.

## About 

I have built Bricks mainly for personal use, but I also believe that it has potential and could be an interesting project also for other developers: that's why after two years of internal development and testing I decided to release it publicly. It is, as a matter of fact, my first open-source project.

While suiting my needs and providing an excellent foundation for my web-development projects, it is of course improvable in many ways, and keeping it up-to-date is always an ongoing activity.

For these reasons, I kindly welcome any kind of feedback, suggestion and contribution, both for the theme itself and for this documentation. Both repositories are hosted on GitHub:

- theme: https://github.com/stefanobartoletti/bricks
- documentation: https://github.com/stefanobartoletti/bricks-docs
